Shoushi was founded by the Sho, the third of the heritage groups to come to Dereth from Ispar.  An early warlord built a fortress on Shoushi's current site to protect his people from the creatures of Blackmire Swamp.  As humans pacified their lands, the fortress fell into disuse, and its walls were torn down to build homes.  From this modest beginning, the town of Shoushi grew into a center of trade and commerce, a hub between the capital city of Hebian-To and the western Sho settlements.  Newcomers starting out in Shoushi should speak with Oi Tong Ye, the local agent of the Explorer's Society.

The GEAR KNIGHTS are a mechanized race of unknown origins.  While they are technically machines, they evidence all the personality of the other races of Dereth.\n\nThe Gear Knights usually operate in large Houses, which are organized somewhere between a feudal society and a standing army.  Each House is led by a Primus, and has a portion of the society for which they are responsible.\n\nOn Dereth, those Gear Knights which are allied with the peoples of Dereth come from the schism between the Gold Gear Primus, Atamarr, and the Iron Blade invasion forces which seek to wipe out both the ‘renegades’ and the Isparians on Dereth.  Their previous House ties behind them, and with the blessings and support of Atamarr, the new Gear Knights of Dereth have been given the freedom to build for themselves a new beginning.\n\n

Sanamar is the royal town of the Viamontian domain.  It was founded by King Varicci II and his followers, who pursued the rebellious Duke of Bellenesse through a portal from their homeland in Ispar.  This proud, walled city is built on a seaside bluff on the southernmost of the Halaetan Islands.  From its walls and towers, Viamontians can gaze southeast over the land their King intends to conquer.  Busy as he is with war planning, Varicci himself is rarely seen in the town's ostentatious Royal Hall.  Newcomers who start in Sanamar may wish to speak with one of the Portal Guardians on the road just outside of town.

Desert-dwellers who prefer knowledge and trade to war and bloodshed, the GHARU'NDIM are an eminently honorable, formal culture, but they also have a reputation for being somewhat distant and proud. Of all the peoples of Dereth, they are the most drawn to the mysteries of magic.\n\nPreferring to talk before fighting whenever possible, they speak with great politeness and formality, peppering their speech with honorifics and references to their national hero, the poet Yasif ibn Salayyar.\n\n

The TUMEROK are a race of lizard folk who were largely known as war-like raiders, sacking human towns across the land. This is not the true nature of the Tumerok. In truth the Tumerok once enjoyed a peaceful and artistic existence, and the Aun Tumerok have aspired to return to those ways. The Aun Tumerok who have joined with the Isparians have forsaken the Hea Tumerok and the Virindi influence that has set the Hea against the Isparians. Although the name Tumerok is actually a name outsiders have given to the Tumerok, the Aun Tumerok have learned to accept that name.\n\n

The UMBRAEN and PENUMBRAEN are a people born from the other Isparian heritages, who sought to join with the chaotic powers of the Shadow, and were then transformed into the Umbraen or Penumbraen.  Those who have undergone the transformation into Umbraen or Penumbraen have forgotten and released their pasts into the winds.  They are children of the Shadow, now and forever. Most Umbraen and Penumbraen come from the followers of the Shadow, Isin Dule.  Isin Dule only asks that his new children embrace the chaos and potential they have been given, and use it to raise themselves to greatness.  What follows is in Isin Dule’s own words to his children.\n\n'Folk remember the dark times, when destruction roamed the land. They think of war… death… torment. They blame those of us who walk in the shadow, call us evil. But we are not. We were deceived by the one who ruled us. To understand us, you must first understand him. Hopeslayer, they call him. Bael’Zharon, the fallen lord. He craved power, and gave himself to chaos. His obsession nearly destroyed the world. The shadow’s path runs along the sword’s edge. On One side, untold strength. On the other… madness. The Hopeslayer strayed - and fell.  Look on his face, and swear: I will not follow.'\n\n

ALUVIANS are a fiercely individualistic and warlike people, quick to anger but with a strong love of justice and fairness. Though often suspicious of things new and strange, they are friendly and always prepared with a little help if they can spare it. They are loyal to their feudal lords, but expect to be well-treated in return.\n\nThe first people to arrive on Dereth Island were Aluvians: they have settled in the fields and hills around Lake Blessed.\n\n

Situated in a cove on the shore of Dereth's Inner Sea, Yaraq was founded by hardy Gharu'ndim who had dwelt in the deepest deserts of their homeland.  Even though it is located at the far end of the bitter A'mun Desert, Yaraq is a pleasant town, shaded by lush apple groves and cooled by breezes from the sea.  The dust storms of the A'mun quickly bury any conventional road, so the desert folk built the Desert Way, a path marked by tall hoops hung with cloth, that leads northeast from Yaraq to the other Gharu'ndim towns.  Newcomers who start out in Yaraq may wish to speak with Mara al-Luq, local agent of the Explorer's Society.

The indigenous race of Auberean, the EMPYREANS are a people only recently returned to their world.  During the cataclysmic Olthoi Invasion, the surviving Empyreans were cast into Portalspace in Asheron's last-ditch efforts to save his race from annihilation.  There they remained lost until Asheron was able to locate a small pocket of them trapped in a deep section of Portalspace.  These Empyreans were being drained and altered by the powers of the Virindi, and the rituals of the undead Emperor Geraine.  Weakened and forever altered by their imprisonment, these Empyreans have begun a new life. Now they are trying to understand both what has become of them and the massive changes that have enveloped their world.\n\n
